# swiftui-image-gallery
A simple image gallery example in SwiftUI.

It's basically just a private experiment project with the new [LazyVStack](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/lazyvstack) for SwiftUI (before Grid was released for iOS 14 😉) and some other basic elements. 

You can view images, add them to locally saved favorites and change the grid size (more useful on larger displays). 

The images are remotely fetched from the picsum api: https://picsum.photos
